Search BambooHR for employee profiles

## Set-up
For now, it needs a .env file with an `apiKey` and `orgName` set to the BambooHR API Key and organization name.

## TODO
1. Move from .env file to workflow settings
2. fix quicklook and url open so it works or doesn't download the jpeg (pending BambooHR fixing mimetypes?)
